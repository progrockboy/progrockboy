- 👋 Hi, I’m @progrockboy
- 👀 I’m interested in Music, Python, Spreadsheets, and Magnets
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Jupyter Notebook, GSpread, and the Google Dev console to access live Sheets in Google Drive using Python and Pandas
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me understand how to crunch data better. I'm getting pretty good at Markdown documentation and spreadsheets for organization.
- 📫 How to reach me: @fingerslinger on twitter and insta @progrockboy here.
